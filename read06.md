# The difference between functions and method and objects

1.Functions
>A function is a process or a relation that associates each element x of a set X, the domain of the function, to a single element y of another set Y (possibly the same set), the codomain of the function
2.Method
>is a procedure associated with a message and an object. An object consists of data and behavior; these comprise an interface, which specifies how the object may be utilized by any of its various consumers.
3.Objects
>is a procedure associated with a message and an object. An object consists of data and behavior; these comprise an interface, which specifies how the object may be utilized by any of its various consumers.

## Evaluation conditions and conditional statement

***Condition Evaluation***
>is an important tool. Evaluation determines the condition of a property and specifies future repair needs.
*Condition statements*
>are used to make decisions based on the conditions. Conditional statements execute sequentially when there is no condition around the statements. If you put some condition for a block of statements, the execution flow may change based on the result evaluated by the condition

### USING IF ... ELSE STATEMENTS

>if ... else statement al lows you to provide two sets of code:
1.one set if the condition evaluates to true
2.another set if the condition is false

#### SWITCH STATEMENTS

>A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value
*You have a default option that is run if none of the cases match.
*If a match is found, that code is run; then the break statement stops the rest of the switch statement running (providing better performance than multiple if statements)
