>A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. You could compare scripts to any of the following :
*RECIPES*
>By fo llowing the instructions in a recipe, one-by-one in the order set out, cooks can create a dish they have never made before.
*HANDBOOKS*
>Large companies often provide handbooks for new employees that contain procedures to fo llow in certain situations.
*MANUALS*
>Mechanics often refer to car repair manuals when servicing models they are not familiar with. These manuals contain a series of tests to check the key functions of the car are working, along with details of how to fix any issues that arise.

## WRITING A SCRIPT

***DEFINE THE GOAL***

=======
# WRITING A SCRIPT
*1: DEFINE THE GOAL*
>>>>>>> 726181b23ee17add4ad0b09faf97f503174a914a
>First, you need to define the task you want to achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the computer to solve.
*DESIGN THE SCRIPT*
>To design a script you split the goal out into a series of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this puzzle. This can be represented using a flowchart. You can then write down individual steps that the computer needs to perform in order to complete each individual task (and any information it needs to perform the task), rather like writing a recipe that it can follow.
*CODE EACH STEP*
>Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the compu ter  understands. In our case, this is JavaScript.

/*NUMBERING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY*/
>Each item in an array is automatically given a number called an index. This can be used to access specific items in the array.
*ACCESSING ITEMS IN AN ARRAY*
>To retrieve the third item on the list, the array name is specified along with the index number in square brackets.
*NUMBER OF ITEMS IN AN ARRAY*
>Each array has a property called length, which holds the number of items in the array.
