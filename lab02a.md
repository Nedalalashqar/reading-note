***Growth Mindset***
>A growth mindset is creativity and achieving higher goals and achievements

*What is a growth mindset?*
>Developing the self-abilities of the human being with effort and perseverance
>By contrast, in a fixed mindset, intelligence and talent are seen as fixed traits, suggesting that success comes from these inherent qualities alone, without the need for further development or effort

>I think it’s my inability to use – and stay in – a growth mindset that keeps me from heading home smiling more often. So, I decided to write this to call myself out for moments of fixed-mindedness (and maybe you’ll recognize a bit of yourself in those moments, too), and share my techniques for working through them. If we can get better at catching ourselves in those moments when our brains revert to a fixed mindset, we can pull ourselves back into growth-iness and ultimately be more successful.
*Growing at work, and outside work too*
I’ve been guilty of having a fixed mindset far too often, and I’m working to change that. Things like wisdom and achievement are the products of putting in hard work, not avoiding it. We live in a society where the instant gratification monkey sits on everyone’s shoulder. But the pleasures that result from determination and hard work far outweigh anything that devilish chimp has to offer. The right mindset, like the growth mindset, helps put things in perspective.
