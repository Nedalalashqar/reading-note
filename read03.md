# Version control

>version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software 

# local version control

>Many people’s version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory (perhaps a time-stamped directory, if they’re clever). This approach is very common because it is so simple, but it is also incredibly error prone. It is easy to forget which directory you’re in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you don’t mean to.

# centralized version control

>The next major issue that people encounter is that they need to collaborate with developers on other systems. To deal with this problem, Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCSs) were developed. These systems (such as CVS, Subversion, and Perforce) have a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place. For many years, this has been the standard for version control.

# Distributed Version Control

>a DVCS allows clients to create mirrored repositories to replace any lost information.     - git is DVCS that stores data in file system made up of snapshots           git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it each time you save a changed version of your project
