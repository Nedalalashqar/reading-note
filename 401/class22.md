# Component Lifecycle / useEffect() Hook

## Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?

> Because React is not designed to develop multi-page websites. So, we need to create multiple routes to handle multiple views.

## If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?

## * Outside the <BrowserRouter/>

## * Inside the <BrowserRouter />, outside a <Route />

## * Inside a <Route />

> Inside a <Route /> In order to read the backends of the project


## What does routing do with the components that were rendered when a new route is requested

> We must use it through import

## What does props.children contain?

> props. children does is that it is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component. This component contains an <img> that is receiving some props and then it is displaying {props.

## How do useState() and this.setState() differ?

> setState() does not immediately mutate this. state but creates a pending state transition. Accessing this. state after calling this method can potentially return the existing value.
