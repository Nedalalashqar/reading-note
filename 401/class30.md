#  Application State with Redux

## What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”

> Cookies are automatically saved, sent and removed by the browser. The frontend developer does not have to worry about implementing this part, nor is there any scope of a mistake from the frontend side. This is not true for localstorage.

> -  This is not easily possible to do via localstorage since the store is not shared across domains / subdomains

## Explain 3rd party cookies.

> Third-party cookies are created by domains that are not the website (or domain) that you are visiting. These are usually used for online-advertising purposes and placed on a website through adding scripts or tags. A third-party cookie is accessible on any website that loads the third-party server’s code.

## How do pixel tags work?

> A tracking pixel, also known as a marketing pixel, is a 1×1 pixel graphic used to track user behavior, site conversions, web traffic, and other metrics similar to a cookie. The tiny pixel-sided image is usually hidden and embedded in everything from banner ads to emails
