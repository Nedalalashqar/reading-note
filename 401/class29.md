# Graphs

> A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.

## Vertex

> node means the data object that can has other adjacent vertices or not.a vertex (plural vertices) or node is the fundamental unit of which graphs are formed.

## Edge :

>the connection between two nodes.

## Degree :

> number of edges that the node has.

## Neighber :
> the connected nodes to the node.

## Directed & unDirected Graph

> Directed or called Digraph : that the edge has a direction and one of two connected nodes has the other, and the other one hasnâ€™t. (uni-directional)

> unDirected : both of them has the other node. (bi-directional)

## Acyclic vs Cyclic

> Acyclic and cyclic compounds are the two main groups of compounds that are categorized based on the basic structure of the molecule. The key difference between acyclic and cyclic organic compounds is that acyclic compounds are linear compounds, whereas cyclic compounds are non-linear compounds.
