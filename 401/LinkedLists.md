## What is a Linked List : 

> A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers 

## Types of Linked List : 

1. **Singly Linked list** : The singly linked list is a data structure that contains two parts, i.e., one is the data part, and the other one is the address part, which contains the address of the next or the successor node. 

2. **Doubly linked list**: the doubly linked list contains two pointers. We can define the doubly linked list as a linear data structure with three parts: the data part and the other two address part.

3. **Circular linked list** : A circular linked list is a variation of a singly linked list. The only difference between the singly linked list and a circular linked list is that the last node does not point to any node in a singly linked list, so its link part contains a NULL value

4. **Doubly Circular linked list** :  It is a doubly linked list also because each node holds the address of the previous node also. The main difference between the doubly linked list and doubly circular linked list is that the doubly circular linked list does not contain the NULL value in the previous field of the node.

 

## What’s a Linked List, Anyway?
> In computer science, a linked list is a linear collection of data elements whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory. Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.

 

## Linear data structures 

> One characteristic of linked lists is that they are linear data structures, which means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed. We can think of a linear data structure like a game of hopscotch: in order to get to the end of the list, we have to go through all of the items in the list in order, or sequentially. Linear structures, however, are the opposite of non-linear structures. In non-linear data structures, items don’t have to be arranged in order, which means that we could traverse the data structure non-sequentially.

 

## Memory management
> The biggest differentiator between arrays and linked lists is the way that they use memory in our machines

 

## what even is Big O?
>anything that we code — is all about efficiency and tradeoffs. Whether you’re building software as a service, choosing a front end framework, or just trying to make your code DRY and more elegant, that’s what all of us are striving towards

 

## Growing a linked list

>just like with an array, we can add elements and remove elements from a linked list. But unlike arrays, we don’t need to allocate memory in advance or copy and re-create our linked list, since we won’t “run out of space” the way we might with a pre-allocated array.

 

## To list or not to list?

> a linked list is usually efficient when it comes to adding and removing most elements, but can be very slow to search and find a single element.
