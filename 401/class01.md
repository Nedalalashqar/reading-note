# Review, Research, and Discussion

## Array.map()
> The map() method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

## Array.reduce()
> The reduce() method executes a reducer function for each value of an array. reduce() returns a single value which is the function's accumulated result. reduce() does not execute the function for empty array elements. reduce() does not change the original array.

## superagent()
> SuperAgent is light-weight progressive ajax API crafted for flexibility, readability, and a low learning curve after being frustrated with many of the existing request APIs. It also works with Node. js

## .then()
> The then() method returns a Promise. It takes up to two arguments: callback functions for the success and failure cases of the Promise.

## async / await 
> An async function is a function declared with the async keyword, and the await keyword is permitted within them. The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure promise chains.

## Promises 
> The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

## Are all callback functions considered to be Asynchronous? Why or Why Not?
> Simply taking a callback doesn't make a function asynchronous. 
> It iterates over each item and calls the function once per item.
