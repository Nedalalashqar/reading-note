## Describe an application that would need access control.

> Access control is a method of guaranteeing that users are who they say they are and that they have the appropriate access to company data.
> At a high level, access control is a selective restriction of access to data. It consists of two main components: authentication and authorization, says Daniel Crowley, head of research for IBMâ€™s X-Force Red, which focuses on data security.

## What is a role used for?

> use to give the user authorization ,The assignment of access rights in RBAC is very systematic and repeatable, easier to audit user rights (users are in only one of a few categories), and easier to correct any issues that are identified. There is no case by case assignment of roles, users fall into one of already pre-assigned roles/capabilities.

## Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
