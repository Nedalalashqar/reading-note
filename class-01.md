# HTML structure

> HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the basic structural element that is used to create webpages. HTML is a markup language, which means that it is used to “mark up” the content within a document, in this case a webpage, with structural and semantic information that tells a browser how to display a page
> Examples of browsers are:

* *Firefox*
* *Internet Explorer*
* *Safari*
* *Chrome*
* *Opera to etc*

## The Evolution of HTML

> The first version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993. Since then, there have been many different versions of HTML Evolution are :

1. **HTML 1.0** :HTML 1.0 was the first version of HTML, used from 1989 to 1994. It was a very limited version and included only 20 elements. There wasn’t much that could be done with it and therefore most webpages ended up looking very similar due to the inability to do things such as; alter the page background, determine fonts and use tables and forms.
2. **HTML 2.0** : Created in 1995, this version was a significant improvement to HTML 1.0. “HTML 2.0 becomes the first official set of standards for HTML — the base standard by which all browsers were measured until HTML 3.2.” (Bartels, 2011). It was able to support the changing of a page background, text colour, text face, the use of tables and text boxes etc. It was around this time that W3C (The World Wide Web Consortium) was created — an organisation which develops web standards. HTML 2.0 also started to support more browsers.
3. **HTML 3.2** : In January 1997 HTML 3.2 was endorsed by the W3 Consortium and approved of by many, including significant browsers such as Netscape and Microsoft. “HTML 3.2 included tables, applets, text flow around images, subscripts and superscripts.” (W3.org, 1998)
4. **HTML 4.01** : This version of HTML, created in 1999, included cascading style sheets (css) which allowed aspects such as text, colour, font and backgrounds to be easily altered. Instead of these aspects being included directly within the webpage, they are now separated, making it much more trouble-free.
5. **HTML 5** : HTML 5 is the current version of HTML which is used. “We’ve come a long way since HTML could barely handle a simple page layout. HTML5 can be used to write web applications that still work when you’re not connected to the net; to tell websites where you are physically located; to handle high definition video; and to deliver extraordinary graphics.” (Marshall, 2017). HTML 5 continues to evolve and is supported by all of the biggest browsers such as Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, Opera and Edge. And it is referred to as HTML5 <!DOCTYPE html>

### HTML5 Layout

> For a long time, web page authors used < div  > elements to group together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes to indicate the role of the < div > element in the structure of the page.
> HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the
parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content
you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not
stopped many web page authors using them already.

#### Process & Design

>Web designers often think about the web design process with a focus on technical matters such as wireframes, code, and content management. But great design isn’t about how you integrate the social media buttons or even slick visuals. Great design is actually about having a website creation process that aligns with an overarching strategy.
> For me, steps to design a website requires 7 steps:

* **Goal identification**: Where I work with the client to determine what goals the new website needs to fulfill. I.e., what its purpose is

* **Scope definition**: Once we know the site's goals, we can define the scope of the project. I.e., what web pages and features the site requires to fulfill the goal, and the timeline for building those out

* **Sitemap and wireframe creation**: With the scope well-defined, we can start digging into the sitemap, defining how the content and features we defined in scope definition will interrelate

* **Content creation**: Now that we have a bigger picture of the site in mind, we can start creating content for the individual pages, always keeping search engine optimization (SEO) in mind to help keep pages focused on a single topic

* **Visual elements**: With the site architecture and some content in place, we can start working on the visual brand. Depending on the client, this may already be well-defined, but you might also be defining the visual style from the ground up. Tools like style tiles, moodboards, and element collages can help with this process

* **Testing**: By now, you've got all your pages and defined how they display to the site visitor, so it's time to make sure it all works. Combine manual browsing of the site on a variety of devices with automated site crawlers to identify everything from user experience issues to simple broken links

* **Launch**: Once everything's working beautifully, it's time to plan and execute your site launch! This should include planning both launch timing and communication strategies — i.e., when will you launch and how will you let the world know? After that, it's time to break out the bubbly
