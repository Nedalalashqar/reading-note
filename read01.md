# Text Editor

>A text editor is a type of computer program that edits plain text. ... Text editors are provided with operating systems and software development packages, and can be used to change files such as configuration files, documentation files and programming language source code.
*Benefit is text editor*
>Faster t Edit: For simple edits, it is often faster to make changes to a page using a text editor.
>Helps You Learn HTML: Text editors teach you to read HTML. They often have wizards and functions to do the more common tasks (like the basic page tags), but you'll learn HTML and basic coding if you use a text editor.
>More Marketable: A web developer who can write HTML using a text editor will be more marketable than one who can only use a WYSIWYG editor. The former is more flexible and can get up to speed on any HTML editing tool, while the latter has to start all over with each new editing tool.
>No "Funky" HTML: The only HTML that will be in the document will be tags that you placed there deliberately. This will help your pages download faster, as well as look leaner.
>Human Readable HTML: This is especially important if you work on a team of web developers. The HTML can be spaced as your team likes it, and include comments or other notes to allow more efficient editing by other team members.
>Must Know HTML: While most HTML text editors can help with tags and suggest attributes and so on, these helpers are no substitute for knowing HTML. Most modern text editors offer drag-and-drop styles such as bold and italic, but if you can't remember the code for "non-breaking space" your editor might not be able to help.
>Steeper Learning Curve: Because you have to learn both HTML and the editor functions itself, a beginner will find a text editor more difficult to use.
?Harder to "Design" With: Some people find text editors more difficult to design pages in because they can't visualize how the page will look from just the HTML.
