# What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

> Like many companies, Google executives believed that the best teams were made up of the best people. In the words of Julia Rozovsky, an analyst in Google’s People Operations division, “Take one Rhodes Scholar, two extroverts, one engineer who rocks at AngularJS, and a PhD. Voila. Dream team assembled, right?”
> “We were dead wrong,” says Rozovsky, who set out to on Project Aristotle, Google’s two-year project aimed at uncovering what characteristics make up the perfect team. Essentially, why some teams excel while others fall behind. Researchers interviewed over 200 employees and looked at more than 250 attributes of over 180 active Google teams. Their findings have proved particularly useful inside their own organization, which other enterprise teams should take note of.

***What they discovered surprised them?***

> Who is on a team matters less than how the team members interact, structure their work, and view their contributions.
> ***But the most surprising discovery? The key to team success is psychological safety.***

***PSYCHOLOGICAL SAFETY AND THE PERFECT TEAM***

* After the success of Google’s Project Oxygen research, where the company’s People Analytics team studied what makes a great manager, Google researchers applied a similar method to identify the characteristics that make up the perfect team.
* The assumption was that the best teams were comprised of talented individuals. But after recruiting statisticians, organizational psychologists, sociologists, engineers and researchers to help solve the riddle, no matter how researchers arranged the data, it was almost impossible to find patterns.
* As Abeer Dubey, a manager in Google’s People Analytics division, tells the New York Times, “We looked at 180 teams from all over the company. We had lots of data, but there was nothing showing that a mix of specific personality types or skills or backgrounds made any difference. The ‘who’ part of the equation didn’t seem to matter.”

***ESTABLISHING THE RIGHT TEAM NORMS***

> Charles Duhigg, a journalist and author of “Smarter Faster Better” who spent time working with the Project Aristotle team, says it doesn’t matter who is on a team so much as how those people interact. “You could have enemies on a team together or you could have strangers or friends or people who don’t get along at all; you could have all introverts or all extroverts, and as long as they treat each other a certain way, as long as there’s a certain culture, then that team will gel,” Duhigg says.
> In order for a team to achieve psychological safety, there are two characteristics that matter most:

1. *Equality in conversational-turn taking* or when everyone speaks roughly the same amount during a meeting;
2. *Ostentatious listening* or when members of a team demonstrate they are actively listening by repeating what has just been said and making eye contact.
