# CSS

*Whai is Css*
>CSS is the language for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It allows one to adapt the presentation to different types of devices, such as large screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language.

**How CSS works**

>The browser loads the HTML (e.g. receives it from the network). It converts the HTML into a DOM (Document Object Model). ... The browser parses the fetched CSS, and sorts the different rules by their selector types into different "buckets", e.g. element, class, ID, and so on
