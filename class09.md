### Lists, Tables and Forms

***Lists*** : The CSS list properties allow you to: Set different list item markers for ordered lists. Set different list item markers for unordered lists. Set an image as the list item marker. Add background colors to lists and list items.
> In HTML, there are two main types of lists:

1. Unordered Lists (< ul >) - List items are marked with bullets
2. Ordered Lists (< ol >) - List items are marked with numbers or letters

> CSS menu properties allow you to:

1. Set different list item markers for ordered lists
2. Set different list item markers for unordered lists
3. Set an image as the list item marker
4. Add background colors to lists and list items

***Tables*** : This document defines CSS properties for rendering HTML or XML elements as tables and cells. It defines how exiting properties like margin and background work in the context of a table and it adds new properties, such as internal-border.
> *Properties that are commonly used with tables* :

* *width* to set the width of the table
* *padding* to set the space between the border of each table cell and its content
* *text-transform* to convert the content of the table headers to uppercase
* *letter-spacing* font-size to add additional styling to the content of the table headers
* *border-top* border-bottom to set borders above and below the table headers
* *text-align* to align the writing to the left of some table cells and to the right of the others
* *background-color* to change the background color of the alternating table rows
* *:hover* to highlight a table row when a user's mouse goes over it

***Forms CSS*** : CSS form is used to create interactive form for user. ... Attribute Selector: The attribute type of the input form can take a variety of form depending on user's choice. It could be anything out of the possible types like text, search, url, tel, email, password, date pickers, number, checkbox, radio, file etc.
> *CSS properties commonly used with forms* :

* *font-size* sets the size of the text entered by the user.
* *color sets* the text color
* *background-color* sets the background color of the input.
* *border* adds a border around the edge of the input box
* *border-radius* can be used to create rounded corners (for browsers that support this property).
* *:focus* pseudo-class is used to change the background color of the text input when it is being used, and the
* *:hover* psuedo-class applies the same styles when the user hovers over them.
* *background-image* adds a background image to the box. Because there is a different image for each input, we are using an attribute  selector looking for the value of the id attribute on each input.
